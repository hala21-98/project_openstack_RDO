## A Project on how to build a private cloud using Openstack RDO.
OpenStack is a free, open standard cloud computing platform. It is mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service in both public and private clouds where virtual servers and other resources are made available to users and in this project we will build Our Platform which includes full network topology and instances.
You can know more about openstack through the following link - https://docs.openstack.org/yoga/

## 1. Set Up Your Environment

In this project we used CentOS Stream 8-streamn, a single VM of MINIMUM 12 GB RAM, 2 CPUs and 2 NICs
FQDN of machine openstack.lab.local, so we should edit /etc/hosts file.

## 2. Machine preparation :
- Enabling nested virtualization

## 3. Operating System Installation :
1. During the installation of the CentOS OS. Move to Install CentOS Stream 8-stream and click tab on your keyboard.
Thin Type a space to separate than the last kernel option, type net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0

This will enable old Linux NIC card naming (eth0, eth1, â€¦etc).

2. Now you see the installation screen, Click on Network & Host.

2.2 Now, the network card got an IP from the DHCP. configure the IP manually by clicking configure. Give the card the same fetched configuration from DHCP.
     >> Disable IPV6 and configure IPV4

2.3 Select the Installation Destination and choose your HDD, just click to Done button if u just have one HDD.

2.4 Click the Time and Date button and select Cairo as your local time zone, Make sure that NTP on the top right is enabled, click on the gear icon and wait for a moment to make sure it is syncing with centos public NTP servers.

2.5 For Software Selection, please, select Server with GUI

2.6 create root password,

2.7 create user and make him Admin,

3. Once all are set. Begin the OS installation.

4. When the installation is over Reboot and Accept the Licenses,

## 4. Prerequisites Deployment:

As a prerequisite, you have to install the needed repos and Adding to that, you must disable some services and enable the legacy network service.
The below section illustrates the actions we have to follow:
Firstly, we need to check the hostname, and check if we can reach the internet or not, and switch to be root.

1. Switch to root,
